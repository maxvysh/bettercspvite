Working on a better course schedule planner for Rutgers because the current one kinda sucks
Some improvements already implemented include: 
- Better UI

Improvements planned in the future:
- Live update for sections (whether they are open or closed)
- An easier way to see which classes are necessary for your major (not sure how ill implement that but ill make it work)
- Built in course sniper
